# UltimateTicTacToeAI

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, a significantly more complex variation of ordinary Tic-Tac-Toe, is impossible to brute force due to the large number of possible games. Because of this, we aimed to develop a minimax AI paired with a heuristic-based board state evaluator that could consistently win against both human and AI opponents. Experimenting with two variations of hill climbing, which we call “Adversarial” and “Archetypal”, we iteratively updated a set of weights in our heuristic-based algorithm to maximize the win rate for our AI player.
